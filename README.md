# Welcome to the Machine Learning part of PondPedia!

## Description
PondPedia is a mobile-based guide and decision support system application designed to help freshwater aquaculturists in Indonesia improve their farming practices. Implement technology to provide real-time estimation for when fish will be ready for harvest, feeding schedules, and recommendations for the amount and type of fish and feed based on water and fish type.

## About the Dataset
[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ogbuokiriblessing/sensor-based-aquaponics-fish-pond-datasets) that are being used were generated from freshwater aquaponics of the African catfish (Clariasgariepinus) conducted by HiPIC Research Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Nigeria Nsukka. Read more about the dataset and how it was generated by visiting their [website](https://aquaponics.hipiclab.org/the-project/).

## EDA Dataset
We have performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns. You can find the details of our EDA in the [data preprocesing](https://github.com/PondPedia/machine-learning/tree/main/dataset/data_preprocessing) folder.

## Cleaned Dataset
We have cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure its quality and suitability for training machine learning models. You can access the cleaned dataset in the [dataset](https://github.com/PondPedia/machine-learning/tree/main/notebook/dataset) folder.

## Model Machine Learning
We have employed advanced machine learning models to tackle different aspects of the aquaculture process. Here are the models we have developed:

**LSTM Model:** We utilize the LSTM model to predict water quality accurately. You can explore the implementation details in the LSTM folder.

**Regression Model:** To predict the optimal fish harvest time, we have built a regression model that takes various factors into account.

## Deploy Model
You can access the deployment-ready models and the required supporting files in the [model to deploy](https://github.com/PondPedia/machine-learning/tree/main/online_prediction/assets) folder. We have also included additional files necessary for smooth deployment in the [support files for deploy](https://github.com/PondPedia/machine-learning/tree/main/online_prediction) folder.

We hope that our machine learning solutions will enhance your freshwater aquaculture practices and contribute to the success of your ventures. Happy farming!
